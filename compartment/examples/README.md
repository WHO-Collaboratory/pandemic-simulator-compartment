# Compartment Core Examples
This repository contains curated examples of standard compartment models implemented with the repository tooling. They serve as demonstrations of the package's capabilities and starting points for further development. 

These models may be adapted for use in the Pandemic Simulator web application.

The method for categorizing examples has not been selected yet. We may categorize by complexity of model, regardless of application, or by type of model in an epidemiological context.
